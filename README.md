# JTask
JTask is, no doubt, one of many personal todo manager projects in existence. I made it to develop my JavaFX skills. I also used it while developing it to keep track of features to add or bugs to fix.

# Usage
JTask requires no dependencies, so just clone and import as usual.

# Status
JTask's development is currently suspended. It may one day see a Scala port.
